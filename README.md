# Scenario for Discussion
A local medical clinic wants to improve its patient intake process. Currently, patients fill out paper forms, which the staff then manually enter into the computer system. The clinicâ€™s manager wants a simple automated solution to speed up this process and reduce errors.

The first step in creating the solution is to design a program that collects basic patient information and stores it in an organised format.

# What I have done
I wanted to use TDD approach as engineering team of the company I work for is using strict TDD. 
I wrote methods to validate patient information entered, and tests to test those methods.
